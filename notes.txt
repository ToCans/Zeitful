### Major Additions to make:
- Move from storing all of the data on the server to storing it in the 
WebBrowser's DB
- Then allow the user to import and export their data.
- Give the user the permission to set up and configure their own server 
for storing data.
- Make some local scripts to allow for easy server setup. So that users 
can work easily with the web tool.
- Add a times column for when certain pieces of work are completed.
- Adjust storage to: topic > task
- Final data storage like so:
id | Topic | Task | Time |

- Final topic storage like so:
